! Estimated using an average for rate rule  
(avraged, have no reverse reaction)


! Kinetics were estimated in this direction instead of the reverse because:
! Both directions are estimates, but this direction is exergonic.
(avraged and averaged)


! Kinetics were estimated in this direction instead of the reverse because:
! This direction matched an entry in intra_H_migration, the other was just an estimate.
(exact, averaged)

! Kinetics were estimated in this direction instead of the reverse because:
! Both directions matched explicit rate rules, but this direction is exergonic.
(exact, exact)

! Exact match found for rate rule [R4H_SSS;C_rad_out_H/NonDeC;O_H_out]
! Kinetics were estimated in this direction instead of the reverse because:
! This direction matched an entry in intra_H_migration, the other was just an estimate.

! Estimated using template [R3H_DS;Cd_rad_out_singleH;XH_out] for rate rule [R3H_DS;Cd_rad_out_singleH;O_H_out]
! Kinetics were estimated in this direction instead of the reverse because:
! Both directions are estimates, but this direction is exergonic.
